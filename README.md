# Vault Nickname (a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))

![Before and after: arbitrary user-provided vault nicknames.](docs/media/vault-nickname-feature.png)

This plugin is intended to disambiguate vaults with the same folder name for users who adhere to a common folder structure between projects. Choose a name to display for a vault without needing to rename its folder. The names are displayed in the vault dropdown menu.
